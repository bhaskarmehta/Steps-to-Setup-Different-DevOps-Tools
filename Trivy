Install Trivy in Ubuntu Server or Inside a Jenkins Server

sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy


Now to Get the report in HTML format
========================================
mkdir -p contrib
curl -o contrib/html.tpl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/html.tpl


And then report will be generated as - trivy image --format template --template "@contrib/html.tpl" -o report.html python:3.4-alpine



OWASP vs Trivy
======================
Data Sources
-----------
Trivy = GHSA (GitHub Advisory Database) + NVD + distro security feeds(Red Hat, Debian, Alpine - Operating-system package advisories maintained by vendors).

OWASP = Mostly NVD (CPE-based- Common Platform Enumeration).

Matching Approach
---------------
Trivy = Matches exact package coordinates, more accurate.
-> If Project has spring-core-5.3.30.jar.
-> If a CVE only affects spring-core < 5.3.18, Trivy won’t flag your 5.3.30 version.

OWASP = Uses CPE names, so sometimes matches too broadly (false positives).
-> False Positive - A false positive is when the scanner reports a vulnerability that doesn’t actually affect your project.
-> OWASP mainly uses CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) strings to match libraries against vulnerabilities in the NVD (National Vulnerability Database).

Example:
  Project has spring-core-5.3.30.jar.
  NVD lists a vulnerability for spring-core-5.3.0.
  Dependency-Check may wrongly assume all 5.3.x versions are affected → false positive.

Update Frequency
-----------------
Trivy DB updates every 6 hours.

OWASP relies on NVD feeds (sometimes slower to reflect new CVEs).
